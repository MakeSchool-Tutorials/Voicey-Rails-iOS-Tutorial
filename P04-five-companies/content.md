# Find 5 jobs

To prepare for our full day outcomes workshop, find 5 job descriptions of companies where you'd like to work. These companies should be:
* in your role of interest: iOS, Web, Front End, Full Stack, etc
* at your "match level" as noted in the company fit rubric
* in line with the results of your "internship readiness results"

Keep in mind you may have trouble finding a role that feels right to you. That's ok. Later we'll cover pro tips on how to find great companies. For now, this is just an exercise we will be building off of in the workshops.

Be sure the save the five links to companies here.
