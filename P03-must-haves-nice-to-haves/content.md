Great! You've filled out the rubrics. Now you have a sense of where you stand in the job marketplace.

Before we look, we need to do a bit more introspection.

Perhaps there are some *constraints* to your job search. Maybe it's critical that you work back home near your family in New York? Maybe you only want to work somewhere with a lot of mentorship? Or, you want to work somewhere that builds a product you believe in?

These are *Must Haves* of your job search - things that are deal breakers. ALL possible roles MUST fill these requirements or else you won't want to work there. You can think of these as parameters that must pass in a unit test.

Reflecting on your must haves makes your job search easier - it allows you to immediately discard roles that don't meet your requirements.

When creating your must haves - don't be too picky. You are early in your career and you won't have as wide a range of job opportunities as you will when you are a seasoned engineer. For this reason, it's ok to settle for a role that meets most of your requirements but not all. You can always transfer to another company in your next job.

# Must Haves
Make a list of "must-haves" for your current role.

# Nice to haves
Nice to haves are qualities that you'd like to be part of your job but are not a necessary  requirement. These might include free lunch, short commute, pet friendly, etc.

Take some time to list out your "nice to haves".

#All together now!

Here's a list of Must Haves and Nice to Haves from a previous class. Compare it to your list and update your own.

Now you have a solid foundation from which to evaluate job fit. Let's move onward to our next phase of the process ...
