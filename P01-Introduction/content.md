## Top Row: Shipped products
The top row of the Mastery Tree is your portfolio. Your Github and shipped products are the foundational credibility of your talents as an engineer. These, more than anything else, demonstrates your ability to build high quality products.

Before applying jobs, it's important to have ~3-4 projects shipped that you are proud of. Luckily we've been working on this all year!

## Top Half: Ongoing Interview Preparation
We've structured interview preparation into the Make School calendar. These are represented in the items in the top half of the Outcomes Mastery Tree:
* Mock Technical Interviews - we'll practice these every week in core.
* Tech Interview Rubric Pass - Captain rainbow and a google engineer designed this technical interview rubric. You'll keep practicing technical interviews until you attain a 3 or 4 in 6 out of 8 categories. Everybody will put in dozens of hours of practice over the coming months. So if you start off with a low score, have no fear. Time to level up.
* Behavioral Interviews - we'll practice these in outcomes workshops and a few core classes
* Mentor Coffees - these are an opportunity to meet up with engineers at a company of interest. You can also ask about their work environment to gain insight into what companies would be a good fit for you.
* 100% of code in Github - this allows recruiters to see the code quality of your projects.
